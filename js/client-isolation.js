/**
 * @file client-isolation.js
 * AT&T and PMI editions of this Builder are two separate repositories deployed to two paths
 * of the SAME origin (`kittu-rulz.github.io/Rise-Component-Builder-ATT/` and `.../-PMI/`).
 * `localStorage` and IndexedDB are scoped per ORIGIN, not per path, so before this file
 * existed both editions read and wrote the exact same keys — `rise-builder-projects-v1`,
 * the `rise-component-builder-media` database, and so on — and could list, open, edit or
 * delete each other's projects and media in the same browser profile
 * (27 September 2026 functional audit, section 3).
 *
 * `EDITION` is the one line that differs between this file and the AT&T repo's copy of it —
 * a literal baked into the build, never detected at runtime (from a URL, a query param, etc.),
 * so it can never be ambiguous or spoofed. Every other module that needs to namespace a key
 * imports from here, so the two repos can never disagree with themselves about their own name.
